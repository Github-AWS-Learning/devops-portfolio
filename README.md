# 👋 Hi, 

I'm a DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in:
- 🛠️ AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, RDS ...)
- 📦 Docker, ECS, EKS, JFrog artifactory, Grafana
- 🧱 Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- ⚙️ CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- 🔒 DevOps security, cost optimization, and automation

I specialize in building **reliable**, **automated**, and **cost-efficient** cloud infrastructure for startups and small teams.
